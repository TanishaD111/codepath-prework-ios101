## App Brainstorming:

1. Instagram
- The ability to message friends directly and share content with them.
- I can upload stories of things I do during the day and people can view or like it.
- I can view long-form content and short-form content by different people and scroll through it. 

2. Facebook
- I can stay connected with family and friends by sharing updates and photos.
- I can join groups that match my interests and participate in discussions with people who share the same hobbies as me. 
- I can explore a lot of news and videos those are tailored to my preferences. 

3. Snapchat
- I can send quick pictures to friends with fun filters and captions on it, which makes for our conversations being fun. 
- I can keep streaks going, which feels like a nice daily challenge to stay in touch with people who aren't as close to me. 
- I enjoy exploring stories from friends and celebrities, which gives me a glimpse into their daily lives. 

4. YouTube
- I can watch tutorials and learn new skills from creators who simplify complex topics, such as baking or exercise. 
- I enjoy discovering new entertaining videos from vlogs to shorts that make me laugh or feel inspired to do something.
- I can subscribe to my favorite channels and get notified when they post new content, which ensures that I don't miss out.
